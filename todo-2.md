## üìù **Implementation Notes**

### Recommended Order of Execution:
1. **Start with Priority 1** (Phases 1.1-1.4): Build the autonomous memory and RAG foundation
2. **Move to Priority 2** (Phases 2.1-2.6): Complete the document processing pipeline
3. **Implement Priority 3** (Phases 3.1-3.4): Polish the chat experience
4. **Add Priority 4** (Phases 4.1-4.4): Enhance AI capabilities
5. **Cherry-pick from Priority 5**: Add features as desired

### For Personal Laptop Optimization:
- Use **Chroma** for vector DB (lightweight, no server required)
- Consider **local embedding models** (sentence-transformers) to reduce API costs
- Use **SQLite** instead of PostgreSQL if simpler setup preferred
- Skip authentication/authorization unless sharing with others
- Focus on **offline-first** capabilities where possible

### Estimated Time:
- Priority 1: 2-3 weeks
- Priority 2: 2-3 weeks  
- Priority 3: 1-2 weeks
- Priority 4: 2-3 weeks
- Priority 5: 1 week

**Total: 8-12 weeks for core features**
