## 🚀 How to Use

### Access the Document Manager

1. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   # Backend
   cd backend
   ./start.bat

   # Frontend
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to Documents page:**
   - URL: `http://localhost:5173/documents`
   - Or add the DocumentManager component to any route

### Upload Documents

1. **Drag & Drop:**
   - Drag files directly onto the upload area
   - Supports multiple files

2. **Browse:**
   - Click "Browse Files" button
   - Select one or multiple files

3. **Supported Formats:**
   - PDF (.pdf)
   - Text (.txt)
   - Markdown (.md)
   - Word (.docx)
   - HTML (.html, .htm)

### Manage Documents

1. **Search:** Type in the search bar to filter by filename
2. **Filter:** Select file type from dropdown
3. **Preview:** Click eye icon to view document content
4. **Debug:** Click chevron icon to view chunks and metadata
5. **Delete:** Click trash icon for individual delete
6. **Bulk Delete:**
   - Check multiple documents
   - Click "Delete Selected"
   - Confirm deletion

### Collection Scopes

- **Global Memory:** Shared across all chats
- **Chat Memory:** Isolated per conversation

---

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
cd backend
python test_phase_2_5.py
```

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Document upload
- ✅ List documents
- ✅ Preview document
- ✅ Delete document
- ✅ Bulk upload
- ✅ Bulk delete
- ✅ Cleanup operations

---

## 📊 Technical Details

### Upload Flow

1. User drops/selects files
2. Frontend validates file types
3. Progress bar appears (0%)
4. File uploaded via FormData
5. Backend processes file:
   - Saves temporarily
   - Extracts text
   - Chunks content (1000 chars, 200 overlap)
   - Generates embeddings
   - Stores in ChromaDB
6. Progress updates (100%)
7. Document list refreshes

### Document Grouping

Documents are grouped by filename, showing:
- Total chunks per document
- Combined character count
- File metadata
- Upload timestamp

### Performance Optimizations

- Pagination support (limit parameter)
- Efficient chunk grouping
- Client-side filtering
- Debounced search
- Lazy loading for preview

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### Backend

```python
# Max documents per request
limit = 100  # Default, configurable via query param

# Upload directory
UPLOAD_DIR = tempfile (auto-cleanup)

# Collection naming
global_memory = "global_memory"
chat_memory = f"chat_{chat_id}"
```

### Frontend

```tsx
// Supported formats
const supportedFormats = [".pdf", ".txt", ".md", ".docx", ".html", ".htm"];

// Preview length
max_chars = 1000  // Configurable
```
