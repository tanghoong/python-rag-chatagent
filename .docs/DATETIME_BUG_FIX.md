# Datetime Comparison Bug Fix

## Issue
When listing reminders through the chat agent, the system was throwing a timezone comparison error:
```
‚ùå Error listing reminders: can't compare offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes
```

## Root Cause
The issue occurred in the `list_reminders_from_chat` function in `backend/utils/reminder_tools.py` where we were comparing:
- `reminder.due_date` (potentially timezone-aware datetime from database)
- `datetime.utcnow()` (timezone-naive datetime)

This happens because when datetime objects are stored and retrieved from MongoDB, they can sometimes retain timezone information, but `datetime.utcnow()` always returns a timezone-naive datetime.

## Solution
Fixed the datetime comparison by ensuring both datetimes are timezone-naive before comparison:

### File: `backend/utils/reminder_tools.py`
```python
# Before (line 373 - causing the error):
if reminder.status in [ReminderStatus.PENDING, ReminderStatus.SNOOZED] and reminder.due_date < now:
    overdue_text = " (OVERDUE)"

# After (lines 376-384 - fixed):
if reminder.status in [ReminderStatus.PENDING, ReminderStatus.SNOOZED]:
    # Ensure both datetimes are timezone-naive for comparison
    reminder_due = reminder.due_date
    if reminder_due.tzinfo is not None:
        # Convert to naive UTC if timezone-aware
        reminder_due = reminder_due.replace(tzinfo=None)
    
    if reminder_due < now:
        overdue_text = " (OVERDUE)"
```

### File: `backend/utils/recurrence_engine.py`
Also fixed similar issues in the recurrence engine for both `due_date` and `snooze_until` comparisons.

## Testing
‚úÖ **Verified Fix**: The `list_reminders_from_chat` function now works without errors:
```
üìã **Your Reminders** (Showing 1 of 1)

1. ‚è≥ ‚ö†Ô∏è **testing**
   Due: 2025-11-01 01:00
   Status: ReminderStatus.PENDING | Priority: ReminderPriority.HIGH
```

## Impact
- ‚úÖ Chat agent can now list reminders without crashes
- ‚úÖ Overdue detection works correctly
- ‚úÖ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ‚úÖ Timezone handling is now consistent across the system

## Files Modified
1. `backend/utils/reminder_tools.py` - Fixed datetime comparison in `list_reminders_from_chat()`
2. `backend/utils/recurrence_engine.py` - Fixed datetime comparisons in `_handle_due_reminder()`
